Create a file name LiquibaseConfig.scala in the same directory with sample config like the following
Because this file is different for different computer setting, we put it under .gitignore

import sbt._

object LiquibaseConfig {
  val liquibaseUsernameS = "root"
  val liquibasePasswordS = "root"
  val liquibaseDriverS   = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
  val liquibaseUrlS      = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/instamua?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true"
  val liquibaseChangelogS = "./rest/liquibase/master.xml"
}


*How to run:
It's possible to migrate existing database, but for now, easiest way is run:
sbt rest/liquibaseDropAll => drop the schema
sbt rest/liquibaseUpdate => sync the schema
Any later change, adding into the rest/liquibase/master.xml with author, id(increasing) and run the liquibaseUpdate
